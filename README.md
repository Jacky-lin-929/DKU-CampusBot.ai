CampusBot.ai
The bot that tells you every secret of your university

Critical Analysis
In DKU, we have a mini-campus (a WeChat account sharing Q&A from students in WeChat moment), rate my professors, DKU engage, and so many different websites that are official or unofficial for students to get information. It is important that they have the information to make the determination on, for example, which class to enroll in and “Pri”, what activities held by different departments to participate in according to their taste. So what we are going to create is an almighty website featuring a stunning AI chatbot to help students get information automatically, which, ideally will Eliminate the campus wall.
Existing problems:
1.	Campus Wall & Rate My Professor:
It still uses the traditional form: WeChat moment Posting and Sharing. That’s where the problem lies. It makes it:
1.	Too slow, difficult, and almost, we can say, impossible to find the previously asked questions in the post history.
2.	The update of information is not on time.
2.	DKUHUB:
1.	No syllabus and the contents described by the official instructors cannot demonstrate the real contents and workload of the courses.
2.	The difference between the same courses taught by different professors cannot be seen conveniently and instantly. The information can only come from the students in upper grades.
3.	Not too fast to schedule the courses individually 
3.	DKU engage & Wechat group notice
1.	Not every activity is on the site.
2.	The volume of students using the website is too small
3.	 When a student wants to check the activities in the group chat to reschedule the activities, it’s hard to find the information quickly unless the organizer resends the massage 15 mins before the acitivity.
4.	Tom toolbox:
1.	Functions are limited.
2.	Not so intelligent.

Innovative Solutions
We have proposed a comprehensive website with campus robot, data search, and DKUWEIBO sections. This website has a groundbreaking and innovative robot to build human-machine dialogue pages, making student information search more convenient, purposeful, and interesting. Can cover answers to various questions such as professor evaluations, course evaluations, and resource searches. The data search module integrates various issues and information related to DKU learning and campus life. For example, practical information such as professors and course evaluations, course outlines, restaurants and barber shops around the campus. In addition, the data search section presents the image data of the original campus wall in text form, making the search more convenient. Especially for new students, this website can quickly promote them to adapt to university life and learn about university information. Meanwhile, as an open source website, all DKU classmates, teachers, and even alumni can edit the content to enrich its data scale. We use the first round of machine screening to select meaningful positive reviews and text, and use the points and likes system to encourage users to post positive and useful comments. Additionally, we have developed a module similar to Weibo to showcase real-time campus dynamics and the publication of campus activities, allowing DKU students to better enjoy campus life, enhance social interaction, and cultivate family awareness. Publishing activity notifications in student group chats is not only inefficient, easy to be overwhelmed by news, but also difficult for students to discover. We have created a DKU activity that allows students to find the desired time period and content in one step.

Possible outcomes:
1.Blog part: students can write and publish blogs with different categories, including recruit, activities, academic, foods& travel, games, sports, and gossips etc.  (similar to 小黑盒，百度贴吧，twitter, weibo)
2. Campus Bot: ChatBot for Q&A, students can input questions about campus life (we aim to cover every area) the bot is similar to ChatGPT and duke library website assistants.  
3. Upload: students can upload comments and suggestions in this part. The template should be like: #Catagories + comments. We will upload the existing campus wall’s data as the initial data to filter the trash and malicious inputs. The second round of reward mechanism prompts students who provide useful information can earn points, and the points reach a certain level to be systematically classified into high-quality accounts, which is more credible and can exchange for some small gifts for the contribution to DKU community. 
Impact:
We aim to combine existing resources to a more comprehensive one, bringing convenience to both students and faculties. By solving the identified issues, the platform contributes to positive change by fostering a more connected and informed campus community. The implications include improved communication, enhanced access to reliable information, and the cultivation of a collaborative environment for knowledge-sharing. For the broader implications, we aim to promote this platform globally, let all high-level institutions have this tool for bringing convenience to students and faculties, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility and engagement.
